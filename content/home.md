Currently working as an Engineering Manager at Wunderkind. Over the past few years I've been working as a Senior Frontend Engineer at few amazing companies including Mastercard, Mediabrix, Small Earth Group and KBS+.

I've spent the past 10 years working in Marketing / Ad Tech, Advertising and FinTech developing applications with clean design and clean code specializing in React, TypeScript and Redux.

Part of my career that I've been extremely proud of is my tenure as an adjunct professor at Kean University teaching a variety of courses including Web Design, Mobile Application Development and Human Computer Iteraction.
